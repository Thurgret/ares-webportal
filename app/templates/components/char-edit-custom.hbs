    You can add new wargear using the dropdown menus below.
    
    Equipment choices can be freely changed during the Fellowship Phase, that is, non-adventuring downtime. Mail armour is available based on standard of living, while hobbits and dwarves also have certain equipment restrictions.
    You will see changes reflected on your character's sheet after refreshing the page.

    <p>Your character can have one Reward per point of Valour they have, which means one Reward at the start - likely picked at chargen. You can change these during the Fellowship phase, through a request.<br><br>
    The available Rewards are as follows:<br><br>
    Close-fitting (armour or helm): When you make a PROTECTION roll while wearing a close-fitting armour or helm you add +2 to the result.<br>
    Cunning Make (armour, helm or shield): Reduce the Load rating of the selected item by 2 (to a minimum of 0 Load).<br>
    Fell (weapon): Add 2 to the Injury rating of the selected weapon.<br>
    Grievous (weapon): Add 1 to the Damage rating of the selected weapon.<br>
    Keen (weapon): Attack rolls made with a Keen weapon score a Piercing Blow also on a result of 9 on the Feat die.<br>
    Reinforced (shield): Add 1 to your shieldâ€™s Parry bonus.
